# Web Task 2 - Phones

### There are 2 options here. If you are still uncomfortable with createing MVC applications then follow these instructions.

1. You will be building a MVC Web application that is a cell phone catalog. 
2. You will need to find 7-10 properties of a smart phone that you want to capture and display to a user.
3. You will need to be able to:
  1. Sort by columns
  2. Search by columns
  3. Paginate the phones list
  4. Seed the database with a sample set of phones
  5. Add, edit, delete phones
4. Use the following tutorials to create your project as necessary
  1. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-2.0&tabs=aspnetcore2x
  2. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.0

### If you are looking for a slight challenge then you can follow these tutorials for Razor Page applications
1. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio
2. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-2.1

## Additional challenges -- Complete the above first and then try these
1. Accept an image of a phone as a property: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/file-uploads?view=aspnetcore-2.1
2. Create a tag helper for one of the properties: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1
3. Create a new view that displays all the phones using a nicer looking details view, think of an amazon search result, no tutorial for this but can be done easily enough
